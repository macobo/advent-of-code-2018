It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions.\n",

You see, believe it or not, this box contains something that will solve all of Santa's transportation problems - at least, that's what it looks like from the pictures in the instructions.\" It doesn't seem like they can read whatever language it's in, but you can: \"Sleigh kit. Some assembly required.\"\n",
